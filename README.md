# Social Network API challenge

## Description

My motivation for this project was to make a social network API. This consists of using js, express mongoDB to make a interactive db. I created the paths to create a user, for that user to create their thoughts, react to other thoughts and add friends. I accomplished this with my skills in js, express and my knew knowledge of mongoDB.
